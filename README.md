# Dynamic Modeling of 3-Dimensional Marine Fields: Unleashing the Power of Convolutional Transfomers for Advanced Environmental Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the thesis project on simulating marine biogeochemical variables using a Convolutional Transformer with Hierarchical Attention. This research focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to model and simulate key variables in the Mediterranean Sea.

## Thesis Abstract

Planet Earth is a blue planet, with the ocean covering over two-thirds of our world. This thesis explores the relationship between humanity and the water, delving into the complexities of marine biogeochemistry. Using a Convolutional Vision Transformer with Hierarchical Attention and the MedBFM dataset, the research aims to simulate critical variables such as chlorophyll, net primary production, and nutrient concentrations.

## Repository Structure

- `code/`: Contains the implementation of the Convolutional Transformer model.
- `results/`: Houses visualizations and analysis results obtained from running the model.
- `docs/`: Documentation files, including the thesis document and any related resources.

## Instructions

To replicate the experiments and explore the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/inesfrodrigues/Convolutional-Transformer.git
```
2. Navigate to the `code/` directory:

```
cd code/
```

3. Run the simulation script:
   
```
python3.8 main.py
```

4. Explore the `results/` directory for visualizations and analysis outputs.

## Future Works
The project's future works include:

Simulating the entire Mediterranean Sea by conducting multiple simulations for various small regions.
Exploring alternative model architectures, particularly if computational resources allow simulating the entire Mediterranean Sea in one go.
